    "Feedforward networks feed information straight straight through (never touching a given node twice), while recurrent neural networks cycle it through a loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of feedforward networks, input examples are fed to the network and transformed into an output; with supervised learning, the output would be a label, a name applied to the input.\n",
    "A feedforward network is trained on labeled inputs until it minimizes the error it makes when guessing their categories. A trained feedforward network can be exposed to any random collection of inputs, and the first input it is exposed to will not necessarily alter how it classifies the second. That is, a feedforward network has no notion of order in time, and the only input it considers is the current example it has been exposed to. Feedforward networks are amnesiacs regarding their recent past; they remember nostalgically only the formative moments of training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recurrent networks, on the other hand, take as their input not just the current input example they see, but also what they have perceived previously in time. The decision a recurrent net reached at time step t-1 affects the decision it will reach one moment later at time step t. So recurrent networks have two sources of input, the present and the recent past, which combine to determine how they respond to new data. Recurrent networks are distinguished from feedforward networks by that feedback loop connected to their past decisions, ingesting their own outputs moment after moment as input. Recurrent networks have memory. Adding memory to neural networks has a purpose: there is information in the sequence itself, and recurrent nets use it to perform tasks that feedforward networks can’t. \n",
    "That sequential information is preserved in the recurrent network’s hidden state, which manages to span many time steps as it cascades forward to affect the processing of each new example. It is finding correlations between events separated by many moments, and these correlations are called “long-term dependencies”, because an event downstream in time depends upon, and is a function of, one or more events that came before. One way to think about RNNs is this: they are a way to share weights over time.\n",
    "We can describe the process of carrying memory forward mathematically:\n",
    "\n",
    "h_t=/phi(Wx_t+Uh_{t-1})\n",
    "\n",
    "The hidden state at time step t is h_t. It is a function of the input at the same time step x_t, modified by a weight matrix W (like the one we used for feedforward nets) added to the hidden state of the previous time step h_{t-1} multiplied by its own hidden-state-to-hidden-state matrix U, otherwise known as a transition matrix. The weight matrices are filters that determine how much importance to accord to both the present input and the past hidden state. The error they generate will return via backpropagation and be used to adjust their weights until error can’t go any lower.\n",
    "The sum of the weight input and hidden state is squashed by the function φ, either a logistic sigmoid function or tanh.\n",
    "Because this feedback loop occurs at every time step in the series, each hidden state contains traces not only of the previous hidden state, but also of all those that preceded h_{t-1} for as long as memory can persist.\n",
    "Given a series of letters, a recurrent neural network will use the first character to help determine its perception of the second character, such that an initial q might lead it to infer that the next letter will be u, while an initial t might lead it to infer that the next letter will be h.\n"
